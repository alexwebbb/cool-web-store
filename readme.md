Item Store is a generic implementation of a rest based web store, utilizing Node JS, Express, Passport, Mongo, and Stripe, among other things. Designed as a plug and play alternative to services such as Etsy, Item Store requires only an active Stripe key in order to go live. Item Store offers commercial grade security with minimal technical overhead. DDOS protection is provided by Cloudflare.
Item Store generates a session feed, allowing the admin to view user view trends and create charts based on what items users view when visiting the site. The format is an array of item objects which are dated. Each session ends after 15 minutes of inactivity.
