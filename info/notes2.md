okkk thinking about routes

so, there should definitely NOT be a users route, OR an orders route

item route is the only "restful" route type supported.

route probably would go something like this 

domain

domain/group

domain/group/item_id

and then 


domain/login

domain/logout

domain/cart

domain/checkout


and if we are admin we will need


domain/dashboard
